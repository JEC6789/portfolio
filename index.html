                    <h3>The One Thing</h3>
                    <p>On December 31, 2012, I did not yet realize it, but the course of my life was about to change forever. While everyone else was doing what people normally do on New Year's Eve, someone brought their laptop over and was playing <i>Minecraft</i> on it. As the kind of person who's never enjoyed parties, I decided to watch what this person was doing. They had a world opened up that was completely flat, barring a hole that was dug in the ground and a black, rectangular frame with some swirly purple substance inside of it. During their time at my house, they made the aforementioned hole larger, placed down <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Redstone_Dust">some red dust</a> that I thought was blood</p>
